# Harlley Oliveira - Frontend Engineer

I have been working as a software developer since 2002, and have experience with a plethora of technologies ranging from ASP 3.0 to React. Although I have considerable experience as a Full Stack Developer, developing software from initial commit to deployment, I have chosen to specialize my career in Front-End Engineering. I have a passion for Open Source, UX, Design Systems, Marketing, and Jamstack technologies.
